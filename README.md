1 Introduction : 

Nowadays on the Internet there are a lot of sources that generate immense amounts of daily news. In
addition, the demand for information by users has been growing continuously, so it is crucial that the
news is classified to allow users to access the information of interest quickly and effectively. This
way, the machine learning model for automated news classification could be used to identify topics of
untracked news and/or make individual suggestions based on the userâ€™s prior interests. Thus, our aim
is to build models that take as input news headline and short description and output news category.

Result:

In this project, we are predicting whether the news is a real or fake based on the relationship between the
words . We have used the fake and true news datasets for creation of this system. We used to perform Text Preprocessing(Tokenization, Stemming/Lemmatization, Stop word removal), Vectorization to detect the news is
fake or true ,at the last we can obtained an accuracy of 95% ,hence we can declared this news is true.

FUTURE SCOPE :

In the future, a possible improvement would be to employ several meta-data about the source and the author of news, along with social media information diffusion features and use Deep Learning methods with larger datasets. In that way, the fake news detection task would not only be content-based and would improve the prevention of their dissemination in social networks. The proposed features combined with ML algorithms obtained accuracy up to 95% over all datasets.
